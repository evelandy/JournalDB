# JournalDB
Make sure you have a database engine like MySQL, Sqlite3, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL or MariaDB installed first. 

I have included my db file with this so you can test to make sure that you can see the data. 

Make sure that the files and PATHs are pointed in the right directions. 

This program lets you enter/delete/view data created in python and sqlite. For the time being you will add the data through command line.
I am currently working on a newer version of this to possibly add better UI, perhaps GUI. More to come... Thank you
